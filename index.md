## Quick Start

### Deploy from Web Interface

1. Navigate to **Apps & Pipelines** in the dxflow interface
2. Click **Browse Hub** or **Templates**
3. Select a workflow from the category
4. Configure parameters and resource limits
5. Click **Deploy**

### Deploy from CLI

```bash
# Browse workflows at https://dxflow.ai/hub

# Deploy a workflow from its compose file
dxflow workflow create --identity my-workflow <workflow>.yml

# Start the workflow
dxflow workflow start my-workflow

# Monitor progress
dxflow workflow logs --live my-workflow

# Check status
dxflow workflow list
```

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow file follows this structure:

```yaml
# Standard Docker Compose format
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: <workflow-image>
    container_name: <workflow-name>

    # Environment configuration
    environment:
      - PARAM1=value1
      - PARAM2=value2

    # Volume mounts for data
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./results:/results

    # Port mappings
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

    # Resource limits
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '4'
          memory: 8G
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
```
